      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>The power had gone out and it was eerily quiet in the house other than a crackling fire.</p>
      <p>Even the <em>whistle</em> of the wind through baren pear tree outside had slowed to a stop.</p>
      <p>That's when something appeared from the woods from the backside of the house.  Peering outside the window to see what it was...</p>
      <p>one of the doe frequent the azaleas. The deer moved towards the house as usual before lilting, stumbling, and collapsing to the earth. </p>
